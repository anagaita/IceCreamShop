## Tech used:
HTML
CSS

### Observations:
with this project I mainly wanted to improve my CSS skills:
  Used variables for colors and fonts;
  Used flexbox to creat the layout of the multiple elements;
  Parcticed position absolute, relative to parent elements, and centering the with translate;
  Practiced background-image property and size;
  Changed the scroll behaviour and type.
I made a carousel in the flavours section using JavaScript and one thing I want to improve is make the carousel have a circular behaviour instead of a linear one.

#### Things I Learned:
Practiced creating and using variables in CSS;
Practiced flexbox and posicioning of elements relative to others;
Learned to change the scroll type and behaviour;
Learned to make a linear carousel with JS;
Practiced semantic and acessible HTML.
